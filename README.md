# Birmingham-physics-year-2-lab-project-emission-spectra-of-noble-gases
This repository contains the code which Edward Penny and Emir Muhammad wrote to analyse data for the year 2 project emission spectra of noble gases

Due to the fact that we only started to keep copies of our old code approximently two third of the way through the term some of our earliest code is missing but the more recently writen code is has frequent versions showing gradual improvement.

We do not believe it is possible to upload files and add them to the branch of an existing file unfortunetaly. Instead we will upload all of the code seperatly and write documents outlining the changes and improvemnets between the older and newer version.
