# Birmingham-physics-year-2-lab-project-emission-spectra-of-noble-gases
This repository contains the code which Edward Penny and Emir Muhammad wrote to analyse data for the year 2 project emission spectra of noble gases

Due to the fact that we only started to keep copies of our old code approximently two third of the way through the term some of our earliest code is missing but the more recently writen code is has frequent versions showing gradual improvement.

We do not believe it is possible to upload files and add them to the branch of an existing file unfortunetaly. Instead we will upload all of the code seperatly and write documents outlining the changes and improvemnets between the older and newer version.

Helium analysis data V0.1 
Is the earliest version of the code we have. It was written in approximently week 3 of labs. It imports all the data of a given ampule averages all images down to a graph of wavelength agaisnt intensity in arbetry units. It also plots vertical red lines on the graph showing the wavelengths detected which coniside with wavelengths of the true helium emission spectrum.
